# Hytale Plugin Template

This project doesn't contain a ``manifest.json``,
because it's automatically generated by the ``eu.koboo.pluginmanifest`` gradle-plugin.

The ``HytaleServer.jar`` dependency should be automatically resolved from your client's installation,
and added to your project as a dependency, done by the ``eu.koboo.pluginmanifest`` gradle-plugin.
